## <a name="standard"></a> :point_right: About Package Managers

We're currently using `npm`

Don't mix it with yarn

> warning package-lock.json found. Your project contains lock files generated by tools
> other than Yarn. It is advised not to mix package managers in order to avoid resolution
> inconsistencies caused by unsynchronized lock files. To clear this warning, remove
> package-lock.json.

t. Yarn

## <a name="hooks"></a> :point_right: About git hooks

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) can prevent bad `git commit`, `git push` and more

```js
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm test",
      "pre-push": "npm test",
      "...": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
git commit -m '.'
```

_Existing hooks are kept. Requires Node `>= 10` and Git `>= 2.13.0`._

## <a name="formatter"></a> :point_right: About Formatters and Linting

### Formatters

We're using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), which has a pre-commit hook that overwrites the staged files with the correct format

### Linting

Putting [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/) aside, there are no linting hooks in this Angular project for [several](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/only-arrow-functions/) [multiple](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7612#issuecomment-505893948) [reasons](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/issues/763#issuecomment-589962755)

So although using `ng lint` while developing is encouraged, take the most bizarre results with a grain of salt beyond common sense
